4. **Nested Loops:**
- Introduce the concept of nesting loops and provide problem-solving applications.

5. **Looping with Range:**
- Explain the 'range()' function and its use with 'for' loops.

6. **Iterating Through Dictionaries:**
- Show how loops access keys and values in dictionaries.

7. **Common Looping Patterns:**
- Introduce patterns like iterating through files or CSV data processing.

8. **Best Practices and Efficiency:**
- Discuss optimizing loops and introduce alternatives like list comprehension.

9. **Exercise and Activity:**
