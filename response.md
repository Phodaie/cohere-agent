# Module: Object-Oriented Support in Python

## Overview
This module will explore object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, a programming paradigm that enables developers to create reusable and modular code. Python has excellent support for OOP, and understanding these concepts will improve your programming skills.

## Lesson Plan

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- Fundamentals of OOP and its benefits.
- Key concepts: objects, classes, attributes, and methods.
- Advantages of OOP: code reusability, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

### Lesson 2: Defining Classes and Creating Objects
- Using the `class` keyword to define a class.
- Understanding class and instance attributes.
- Initializing objects with the `__init__` method.
- Practice creating objects and accessing attributes.

### Lesson 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Introduction to inheritance and its advantages.
- Relationship between parent and child classes.
- Inheriting attributes and methods.
- Achieving polymorphism through method overriding.

### Lesson 4: Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
- Explanation and purpose of encapsulation.
- Public, private, and protected access modifiers in Python.
- Controlling access to attributes and methods.

### Lesson 5: Advanced Topics and Best Practices
- Composition and aggregation in class design.
- Abstraction and abstract classes.
- MRO (Method Resolution Order) in multiple inheritance.
- Best practices for OOP in Python, including design patterns.

### Lesson 6: Projects and Applications
- Real-world examples and case studies of OOP.
- Student projects: creating a game or simulation using OOP.

### Lesson 7: Review and Assessment
- Recap of key concepts.
- Quiz or exam to assess understanding of OOP in Python.

## Exercises and Assignments
1. Define a class for geometric shapes with attributes and methods for calculations.
2. Create a hierarchy of classes for vehicles, including parent and child classes.
3. Implement inheritance and polymorphism in a class design for an RPG game.
4. Create a "BankAccount" class with encapsulated methods for transactions and balance inquiries.

## Conclusion
Upon completion of this module, students will have a solid foundation in object-oriented programming in Python. They will know how to create classes, objects, and methods, and how to utilize inheritance and polymorphism for efficient and reusable code. This module prepares students to explore more advanced OOP topics and design complex, maintainable programs.
